# ToDo

- Add OS support for Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu
- Write more tests (Travis CI/CD) (Ansible post_tasks, etc.)
- Refactor daemon.json part into an Ansible template mechanism
- set firewall policies by the current used service firewalld or iptables-services (https://github.com/datadrivers/ansible-role-docker/issues/2)
